## steps

1. continue in lvl6 terminal

5.cmd:```find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c``` it will find all files owned by user bandit7 and group bandit6 and size of file is 33 bytes and "/" means root directory
6. we might get files with error  so we will use cmd to find the file with error permissions
7. so remove errors we use cmd with ```2> /dev/null``` which means redirect error to null
8. cmd:```find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null```
